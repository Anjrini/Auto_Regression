# RNN and Auto_Regression - Automation of the Data Preparation

When using the RNN or the Auto Regression method, there is some pre-work quite lengthy to be done in preparing the data to be used in as an arrary format for the RNN or as a data frame for the Auto Regression. 
The idea of this code to take the work off the shoulder and get the data ready for either the RNN implementation or the Auto Regression. This code has been implemented in the file ....... with the function named ........

The input of this function is:
- the data frame on hand
- the name of the x columns to be considered from this data frame
- the name of the y column to be considered
- the lag variable: how much time is the lagging time
- RNN whether True or False: if True is chosen, then the output is related to the RNN method and if False is chosen, then the output is related to the Auto Regression method.

The output of this function is two variable:
- the first variable is the newly implemeted data frame to be used in the RNN or Auto Regression
- the second variable is the new response vector to be used

Should you have any query or suggestion, please drop me a line. I will be more than happy to assist you.
